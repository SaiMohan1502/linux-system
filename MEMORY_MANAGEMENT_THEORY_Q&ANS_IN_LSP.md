## What is memory management in system programming?
```c
Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory,
assigning blocks to various programs, and ensuring efficient use of RAM and virtual memory.
```
## Define virtual memory.
```c
Virtual memory is a memory abstraction that allows programs to use more memory
than physically available by using disk storage as RAM.
```
## Differentiate between physical memory and virtual memory.
```c
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Feature		|	Virtual Memory						|	Physical Memory				 |
________________|_______________________________________________________________|________________________________________________|
Definition	| An abstraction of memory created by the operating system	| Actual hardware RAM installed in the system	 |
Location	| Stored on both RAM and disk (swap space or page file)		| Located on physical RAM chips			 |
Access		| Accessed via logical (virtual) addresses			| Accessed via physical addresses		 |
Size		| Can be larger than physical RAM (extends using disk)		| Limited by the installed RAM in the system	 |
Speed		| Slower due to disk access (if paging occurs)			| Faster since it uses hardware			 |
Purpose		| Allows more processes to run and prevents memory overflow	| Used to actually store and process program data|
Managed By	| Operating System and MMU (Memory Management Unit)		| Directly by the hardware and OS		 |
Example		| A 4GB program running on a system with only 2GB RAM		| The 2GB RAM is the physical memory being	 |

## What is the role of an operating system in memory management?
```c
Allocates and deallocates memory, manages virtual memory, handles page faults, and ensures memory protection and efficiency.
```
## Explain the purpose of memory allocation.
```c
To reserve space in memory for program variables, data, and operations during execution.
```
## Describe the significance of memory deallocation.
```c
Frees memory when no longer needed, preventing leaks and making room for other processes.
```
## Define fragmentation in memory management.
```c
It is the condition where memory space is used inefficiently, reducing available space.
```
## What are the types of fragmentation?
```c
Internal and External fragmentation.
```
## Explain internal fragmentation.
```c
Occurs when allocated memory block is larger than requested memory.
```
## Explain external fragmentation.
```c
Occurs when free memory is scattered in small blocks, not usable for large allocations.
```
## How is fragmentation managed in memory allocation?
```c
Using techniques like compaction, paging, and segmentation.
```
## Describe the concept of paging.
```c
Divides memory into fixed-size pages to eliminate external fragmentation and uses page tables for address translation.
```
## Explain segmentation.
```c
Divides memory into segments based on logical divisions like code, data, stack.
```
## What is the difference between paging and segmentation?
```c
Paging: Fixed-size blocks, avoids fragmentation.

```
## Describe the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).
```c
A cache that stores recent address translations to speed up memory access.
```
## What is TLB miss? How is it handled?
```c
Occurs when the required mapping is not in TLB; the system then looks into the page table.
```
## Discuss the working principle of MMU.
```c
It uses page tables and TLBs to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses dynamically.
```
## Explain the concept of address translation in MMU.
```c
MMU translates logical addresses to physical addresses using page tables and TLBs.
```
## How does MMU support virtual memory?
```c
By mapping pages to physical memory and handling page faults automatically.
```
## Describe the process of page table traversal in MMU.
```c
MMU accesses multi-level page tables to locate physical memory frames.
```

## Explain the LRU (Least Recently Used) page replacement algorithm.
```c
Removes the page that hasnâ€™t been accessed for the longest time.
```
## What is the clock page replacement algorithm?
```c

```
## Discuss segmentation with paging.
```c
Segments are divided into pages, combining benefits of both techniques.
```

```
## What is memory compaction?
```c
Memory compaction is the process of moving allocated memory blocks together to create larger contiguous blocks of free memory and reduce external fragmentation.
```
## Describe the working of memory compaction algorithms.
```c

```c
Technique where hardware registers of devices are mapped into virtual memory, allowing device access as if reading/writing memory.
```

## Discuss the cache coherence problem.
```c
Occurs in multiprocessor systems when different CPUs cache the same memory location and one updates it, causing inconsistencies.
```
## Explain cache replacement policies.
```c
Rules to decide which cache block to evict when new data needs to be loaded: LRU, FIFO, Random, LFU, etc.
```
## What is cache associativity?
```c
Refers to how cache blocks are organized and selected for replacement: direct-mapped, set-associative, or fully associative.
```
## Describe the working of cache memory.
```c
When the CPU accesses memory, it checks cache first. If found (hit), it uses it; otherwise (miss), it fetches from RAM and updates cache.
```
## Explain cache hit and cache miss.
```c
Cache hit: Data is found in the cache.

Cache miss: Data is not in the cache and must be fetched from main memory.
```
## Discuss the importance of cache memory in memory management.
```c
Boosts CPU performance, reduces memory latency, and lowers main memory load.
```
## How does cache memory relate to memory hierarchy?

Cache sits at the top (closest to CPU) of the memory hierarchy, offering the fastest access compared to RAM, SSD, and HDD.
```
## Define memory protection.
```c
A mechanism to control access to memory segments and prevent processes from accessing each otherâ€™s memory.

Defines which memory regions or instructions can be accessed in user vs kernel mode, ensuring system integrity.
```
## Discuss the mechanism of memory protection in modern OS.

Combines MMU, page tables, access flags, and privilege checks to isolate and secure memory between processes.
```
## What are the security implications of memory protection?
```c
