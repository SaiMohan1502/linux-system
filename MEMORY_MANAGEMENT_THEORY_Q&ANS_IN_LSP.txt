1. What is memory management in system programming?
Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory, assigning blocks to various programs, and ensuring efficient use of RAM and virtual memory.

2. Define virtual memory.
Virtual memory is a memory abstraction that allows programs to use more memory than physically available by using disk storage as RAM.

3. Differentiate between physical memory and virtual memory.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Feature		|	Virtual Memory						|	Physical Memory				 |
________________|_______________________________________________________________|________________________________________________|
Definition	| An abstraction of memory created by the operating system	| Actual hardware RAM installed in the system	 |
Location	| Stored on both RAM and disk (swap space or page file)		| Located on physical RAM chips			 |
Access		| Accessed via logical (virtual) addresses			| Accessed via physical addresses		 |
Size		| Can be larger than physical RAM (extends using disk)		| Limited by the installed RAM in the system	 |

Refers to how cache blocks are organized and selected for replacement: direct-mapped, set-associative, or fully associative.

72. Describe the working of cache memory.
When the CPU accesses memory, it checks cache first. If found (hit), it uses it; otherwise (miss), it fetches from RAM and updates cache.
